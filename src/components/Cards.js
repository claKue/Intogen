                            New experiences are emphasised.
                            The focus is on the present and on doing such activities as games, problem solving,
                            simulations.
                            There is a lot of action and excitement.
                            They can lead and be in the limelight.
                            Ideas are generated without any concern about practical constraints.
                            They have to respond to a challenge and take risks.
                            The central focus is on team problem-solving. 
                            Activistis are accomodators:

                            They have the most hands-on approach, with a strong preference for doing rather than thinking. 
                            When they lean they will ask 'what if?' and 'why not?' to support their action-first approach. 
                            They do not like routine and will take creative risks to see what happens. 
                            They learn better by themselves than with others."

                            the learning forms a part of a conceptual whole, such as a model for a theory.
                            There is time to explore the interrelationship amongst elements.
                            They can explore the theory and methodology underlying the subject under investigation.
                            They are intellectually stretched.
                            There is a clear and obvious purpose to the activities.
                            There is a reliance on rationality and logic.
                            They can analyse situations and then generalise their findings.
                            They are asked to understand complex situations.
                            Theorists are assimilators:
                            They have the most cognitive approach, preferring to think than to act. 
                            When they learn they will ask 'What is there I can know?' and like organised and structured understanding. 
                            Lectures are their preference, with demonstrations where possible, and will respect the knowledge of experts. 
                            People with this style will have a strong control need. 
                            They learn best with lectures that start from high-level concepts and work down to the detail."

                            involvement such as listening to a speaker or watching a video.
                            There is time to think before having to act or contribute.
                            There is opportunity for research and problems can be probed in some depth.
                            They can review what was happening.
                            They are asked to produce reports that carefully analyse a situation or issue.
                            There is interaction with others without any risks of strong feelings coming to the fore.
                            They can finalise a view without being put under pressure.
                            Reflectors are divergers:
                            take experiences and think deeply about them. 
                            They diverge from a single experience to multiple possibilities. 
                            When they learn they will ask 'why?', and will start from detail to logically work up to the big picture. 
                            They like working with others but like things to remain calm â€“ they will be distressed by conflicts in the group. 
                            They like to receive constructive feedback."

                            The relevance is obvious and the learning is easily transferred to their jobs.
                            What is done is practical such as drawing up action plans or trialing techniques or procedures.
                            Pragmatists are convergers:

                            When they learn they will ask 'how?', and will want to learn by understanding how things work in practice.
